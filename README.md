## Printing instructions

Thank you for your interest in this Web-to-print experiment. 

> If you just want to read the zine on screen, [download the pdf here](https://yancong.github.io/datacenter/zine_for_screen.pdf)
> If you're ready to print the zine yourself, follow the instructions below:

- Download this folder
- Use any local server
- open `index.html` in your browser (chrome or firefox should both work)
- Print from the browser (crtl+p), set margin to none (0)
- In preview, you should see a book fold layout for a A5 size zine
- Print on A4 paper and staple/bind with your favorite technique!
