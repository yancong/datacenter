<span style="color: #FFFFFF">Welcome to Looking for the Cloud: a data center walk in Science Park, Amsterdam </span>

The walking tour took place on May 27, 2022. I'd like to organize more walks —— if you're interested in joining a future walk please write to yancongphoto _ (at) _ gmail _ (dot) _ com

If you'd like to explore other data center-dense areas in Amsterdam together, please also reach out to me!

Google opened its [first hyperscale data center](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/eemshaven/) in the Netherlands in Eemshaven in 2016, and has worked on an expension since 2019. Satellite images from 2017 and 2022 below shows the comparison of how this data center has expanded.
